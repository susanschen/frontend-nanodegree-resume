# Front-End Nanodegree Resume

## Project Details

This is a project for the Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree course. It is forked from [Udacity Github](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume).

### Mockup:
The final resume will look something like this, which will serve as a guide for the order in which elements are added to the page. The CSS may be customized to show artistic creativity.
